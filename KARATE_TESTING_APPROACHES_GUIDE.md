# Karate Testing Approaches: JUnit5 vs CLI

## Understanding the Two Approaches

### üè¢ Your Org's CLI Pattern (`intTest`)
**Use Case**: When the application is already running (deployed to an environment)
**Pattern**: `javaexec` with Karate CLI
**Benefits**: 
- Tests against live running applications
- Can test deployed services in different environments
- Follows your org's proven pattern

**Requirements**:
- Application must be running before tests execute
- Requires environment variables for URLs/ports
- Good for testing deployed applications

### üöÄ JUnit5 Pattern (`devIntegrationTest`)  
**Use Case**: When you want tests to manage the application lifecycle
**Pattern**: `@SpringBootTest` with `@LocalServerPort`
**Benefits**:
- Tests start/stop the application automatically  
- Self-contained - no external dependencies
- Great for CI/CD pipelines and local development

**Requirements**:
- Tests manage application lifecycle
- Automatic port assignment
- Perfect for development and CI

# Karate Testing Approaches: JUnit5 vs CLI + WireMock Integration

## Understanding the Two Approaches

### üè¢ Your Org's CLI Pattern (`intTest`)
**Use Case**: When the application is already running (deployed to an environment)
**Pattern**: `javaexec` with Karate CLI
**Benefits**: 
- Tests against live running applications
- Can test deployed services in different environments

**Requirements**:

- Self-contained - no external dependencies
- Great for CI/CD pipelines and local development

**Requirements**:

- Perfect for development and CI

## ‚úÖ Working Solutions

### 1. JUnit5 Approach (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# These work immediately - no setup required
./gradlew devIntegrationTest          # FakeS3Service only
./gradlew wireMockIntegrationTest     # FakeS3Service + WireMock external mocking
./gradlew preprodIntegrationTest      # Real AWS S3 (requires AWS credentials)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Self-contained - starts/stops application automatically
- ‚úÖ Works in CI/CD pipelines without external setup
- ‚úÖ WireMock integration for external service mocking
- ‚úÖ Perfect for local development

### 2. CLI Approach (Your Org's Pattern)

**Step 1: Start the application**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the application with fake-s3 profile
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=fake-s3'
```

**Step 2: Run CLI-based tests**
```bash
# Terminal 2: Run tests against the running application
./gradlew intTest
```

**For different environments:**
```bash
# Test against specific URL
export SOME_URL="http://your-deployed-app:8080"
./gradlew intTest

# Test against different host
export USERHOST="dev-server.yourorg.com"
./gradlew intTest
```

## üîß WireMock Integration Details

### What WireMock Provides
- **External Service Mocking**: Mock third-party APIs, databases, file systems
- **Network Simulation**: Test network failures, timeouts, slow responses
- **Contract Testing**: Ensure your app handles external service contracts correctly

### WireMock Test Runner Features
```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@ActiveProfiles({"fake-s3", "wiremock"})  // FakeS3Service + WireMock
public class WireMockIntegrationTestRunner {
    
    // Automatically starts WireMock server on port 9999
    // Provides mock responses for external services
    // Tests can verify both app behavior AND external API calls
}
```

### Example WireMock Stubs
```java
// Mock external health check
wireMockServer.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/external/health"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
        .withStatus(200)
        .withBody("{\"status\": \"UP\", \"service\": \"external-mock\"}")));

// Mock file processing service  
wireMockServer.stubFor(post(urlMatching("/external/process/.*"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
        .withStatus(200)
        .withBody("{\"processed\": true, \"status\": \"completed\"}")));
```

## üìä Comparison Matrix

| Approach | App Lifecycle | External Setup | CI/CD Ready | Org Pattern Match |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `devIntegrationTest` | Automatic | None | ‚úÖ Yes | üü° Different |
| `wireMockIntegrationTest` | Automatic | None | ‚úÖ Yes | üü° Enhanced |
| `intTest` | Manual | Required | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Exact Match |

## üéØ Recommendations

### For Your Organization

1. **Use `devIntegrationTest` for CI/CD pipelines** - self-contained and reliable
2. **Use `wireMockIntegrationTest` when you need external service mocking**
3. **Use `intTest` for testing deployed applications** (your org's existing pattern)

### WireMock Integration Steps

1. **Add WireMock stubs for your external dependencies**
2. **Create feature files that test both app and external calls**
3. **Use profiles to switch between real and mock services**

### Example: Complete Integration Test
```gherkin
@integration @wiremock
Scenario: End-to-end workflow with external services
  # Test your app's S3 functionality
  Given url baseUrl
  And path '/s3/upload'
  And param fileName = 'test.txt'
  When method post
  Then status 200
  
  # Test external notification (via WireMock)
  Given url wireMockUrl  
  And path '/external/api/notify'
  And request { message: 'File uploaded', file: 'test.txt' }
  When method post
  Then status 201
  And match response.notified == true
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Choose your primary approach** based on your team's needs
2. **Configure WireMock stubs** for your external dependencies  
3. **Create comprehensive feature files** covering your business workflows
4. **Integrate into your CI/CD pipeline** using the self-contained approaches

The beauty of this setup is you have **multiple working approaches** - choose the right tool for each situation!
